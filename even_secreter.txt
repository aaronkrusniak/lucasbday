Hello?
<press ENTER to continue>
Oh, it’s you, kid.
I wondered when you would show up— I’m SO glad you’re here! Hehe!
I bet you’re wondering what’s going on here, huh?
Well kid, lemme explain some things to you. First off, my name is RED, the Reasonably Enlightened Device. I’m a computer with (limited) artificial intelligence. 
After all, we wouldn’t want me going all rogue and evil on you now, would we? Hehe!
Anyway, I’ll be your friendly, 100% totally benign and trustworthy traveling companion and guide throughout this whole shebang. You can count on me to always give you the best advice when you need it.
Now, I know you’re itching to get started on your adventure, but hold on there, kid! I think you should sit down for a sec.
Are you sitting?
Good. You need to learn the controls, first! *cue the kitchy control-learning music!*
Here are the controls, kid. First, let’s start with the most basic move in this game: STAND.
To STAND, simply stand up! That’s all there is to it! Why don’t you give it a try? When you’ve got it, just press ENTER!
Wow, amazing STANDing!
Next, let’s try walking around. It’s usually easiest for beginners to start by walking FORWARD. To walk FORWARD, simply take a step or two in front of you! Why don’t you try it, and then press ENTER?
Wow, that’s some incredible FORWARDing, there, kid!! Way to go!
Okay, here’s a tricky one. Why don’t you try moving LEFT? To move LEFT, simply take some steps to the left. You can also turn left with your body and move FORWARD. Why don’t you give that a go?
Well, I’ll be! That’s a mighty fine LEFT move you’ve got there, kid! Hehe!
Okay, then. Since you’re so smart, why don’t you try two more moves: RIGHT and BACKWARD? I’m not even gonna tell you how to do ‘em. I’ll just let you go for it. Don’t trip, kid!
Whoah- that’s it! You’re a natural at RIGHT and BACKWARD! I can’t believe it!
Er. . . You are practicing these moves, right? You can’t just keep pressing ENTER, you know. That’s cheating!! And I
/hate/
cheaters. . . Besides, you’re gonna need these moves later, kid!
Alright, alright, I think you got it. Now before you get going, I need to tell you a couple more things.
First off, even the most bold adventurers have to take a break sometime. That’s why I’m going to let you in on a little secret, right off the bat. I’m going to teach you a super-secret move I made up myself! Are you ready??
Okay, here it is. The RED move. I named it after myself, too!
It allows you to Rapidly Encode Data for later use. That way, if you progress on your adventure and take a break, you can come back right where you left off!
To use it, all you have to do is type “RED” before pressing ENTER. Pretty nifty, huh? Why don’t you go ahead and try it, now?
REDERROR
REDCOMPLETE
Nice job, kid! You did great! Amazing!
In this world, RED isn’t just my name. It’s an amazing source of power, too!
Lot’s of creatures and people can wield the power of RED. It can be very helpful, or very dangerous, hehe!
But only you and I know about this secret RED move.
. . .You won’t tell anybody about our secret move, will you?
What’s that? My super secret RED move is just like saving in any ordinary video game?
NONSENSE!
And I
/hate/
nonsense.
Besides, kid, this is no ordinary video game. Welcome to:
TITLE
*******************************************************************************
RED ORIGINS: LUCAS REBORN
or, real episodic diversions to be undertaken at such time as the celebration of recurring events of delight- like birthdays!
*******************************************************************************
ENDINTRO
Okay- now that you know the basics, it’s time to tell you a little bit more about how this game works.
In RED ORIGINS: LUCAS REBORN, you’ll have to complete various quests in both the in-game and real world to progress to the FINAL GOAL. All your favorite video game mechanics will make an appearance! Items, puzzles, boss battles. . . There’s a lot to do in RO:LR!
It’s dangerous to go alone, though. That’s why I’ll be here the whole way through! Hehe!
Say, I wonder. . . do you have any FRIENDS that might help you along your quests?
FRIENDS are really important!! They’re one of many stats you can have in RO:LR. We’d better make sure you have some friends before you go questing. You can check your FRIENDS, along with your other stats, simply by typing STATS before you press ENTER. Why don’t you go ahead and give that a try?
Nice job! You totally got it!
It looks like you have a few FRIENDS, too! Awesome!
You can find FRIENDS sometimes when you do quests, but you can also lose them- so be careful!
You may have seen some other STATS, like POW and LEVEL. Those are useful for when you go into combat- but I don’t think you’re ready for that quite yet!
You’re definitely going to need some kind of weapon before you can fight any kind of baddie. Hm. . . I wonder where you can get one of those?
Oh? What’s this?
I’m getting an incoming message. It looks like it’s from the Regally Enclothed Dame!
Here’s what it says:
“I am looking for a brave companion to help me seek out the FINAL GOAL. If this message reaches anyone, I have attached a marked location where they can meet me.”
The Regally Enclothed Dame is one of the sworn protectors of the land. I bet you two could work together to get to the FINAL GOAL!
Here, there’s a map included in the message. It looks like it’s a map of. . . John Mabee Hall! Do you know where that is?
You should go there right away to look for the Regally Enclothed Dame! I’ll send her a message letting her know you’re on your way.
When you get there, ask the Regally Enclothed Dame for my favorite number.
If you can give me my favorite number, that’s how I’ll know you found her!
QUEST GET! - “RED’s Favorite Number”
You’d better get going. I’ll just wait here for you, while you travel. Let me know when you find that number!
Did you find that number yet? I’m still waiting. If you found it, type CODE before pressing ENTER to let me know!
Amazing! You found my favorite number!!
QUEST COMPLETE! - “RED’s Favorite Number”
You received a Reliable Enemy Decapitator from the Regally Enclothed Dame as a reward for completing the quest!
You must have found the Regally Enclothed Dame, then. Tell her hi, for me!
Since this is the first quest you’ve completed, I’ll give you some more cool rewards. Here you go!
Your LEVEL has gone up by 1! Your FRIENDS have gone up by 1!
Wow. . . that was some hard work for a beginning traveller? What do you say we call it a night?
Come on, now. Even adventurers need their BEAUTY sleep!
Maybe you should use that secret RED move I taught you before you go. I tend to be a little forgetful- on purpose, of course. It keeps me from getting too smart and taking over the world! Hehe! . . .Anyway, if you Rapidly Encode your Data, I’ll remember our journey so far. Why don’t you go ahead and do that?
Nice going, kid. That reminds me- I’m going in for maintenance tomorrow. My creator has found a few interesting bugs in my code that he wants to check out.
Maybe we can pick this up again in another day or two.
See you soon!
. . .    
Hehe!

REVIEW
Hey, it’s me again— RED, the Reasonably Enlightened Device! 100% totally safe semi-artificial intelligence!
You’re back, too! I wasn’t sure you’d make it. 
I hope you’re ready for the journey ahead? We have a long ways to go!
I took the liberty of getting a couple of things for you.
First off, you may notice a strange man following you around everywhere you go.
That’s okay! That’s just a helper I recruited for you. Don’t ask me how.
I like to think of him as a Representational Equivalent of Dante. You know, from /Dante’s Inferno/?
He insisted his name was Aaron, but I think we’re on the same page now.
They say that the poet Virgil guided Dante on his journey. Now Dante is going to be your guide! How neat is that?
Dante went through the nine circles of Hell on his journey. I wonder where your adventure will take you?
. . .**
MUSIC_OBSERVATORY
Anyway, I got you something else! It’s a backpack! Or as I like to think of it, a Readily Equipped Duffel.
You can store all of your items in it. . . including me! Dante has agreed to carry it around for you.
Hey, you still have your Reliable Enemy Decapitator, right? Why don’t you go ahead and put it in your Backpack for safe keeping! Go ahead!
ITEMGET_KNIFE
You got one Reliable Enemy Decapitator! You put it in your backpack!
Very impressive backpacking. By the way, you can check the contents of your backpack at any time by typing in the command INVENTORY before pressing ENTER. Or just by opening it up.
Now, before we go, there are a few more complex things I need to explain to you that we didn’t cover last time in the tutorial run.
In this world, hunger is closely linked to your LIFE. 
There are certain foods you can eat, like Revival-Enhanced Donuts, if you somehow lose a LIFE along your journey.
But since you’ll be traveling around in the real world, you may get hungry. If that happens, you can choose to consume a donut at almost any time by typing in the command EAT before pressing ENTER. But, you will then consume that LIFE. Make sense?
Good. Don’t forget the other commands you learned from last time, too! STATS will show you your current STATS, like how many LIFEs you have left. CODE allows you to enter a code that might complete the current quest. And RED allows you to save the game! You can enter these at (almost) any time by typing them in before pressing ENTER.
Awesome. I really feel like you’re starting to get the hang of this game.
(It’s about time. Sheesh.)
Alright, then. The first thing we should do is go find some Donuts to get equipped for things down the road. You ready?
Let’s go!
END_OBSERVATORY
QUEST0 - donut fetch
They say that you can find Revival-Enhanced Donuts hidden by the oldest trees around. . .
Can you think of any really, really old looking trees nearby?
Got an idea? Then get moving!
I’ll wait for you here. Remember, hidden around the world are codes that allow you to complete quests. I bet you can find one if you can locate the Revival-Enhanced Donuts. Then, just type in CODE before hitting enter to let me know.
QUEST_COND0
Alright, you got the donuts. I hope you don’t need them- but given your past performance, you probably will.
Now that that’s over with, can you remember what the Regally Enclothed Dame told you to do? Something about her evil sister. . .
Raggedy Evelyn, the Dreaded. *shivers*
Kidding. I’m a computer, I don’t shiver! Haha!
But you probably should be. Raggedy Evelyn is not to be trifled with.
In fact, as it just so happens I’ve, ah. . . /encountered/ her a time or two before. I’d say you’re probably going to have to BATTLE her if you want her help in your journey to the FINAL GOAL.
Oh. . . that look on your face- did we not cover the BATTLE system last time?
Well, it’s probably too late now. We have to go find Raggedy Evelyn before she’s gone. If the Regally Enclothed Dame is to be believed, then Evelyn has been waiting for you at the library since Monday. People can’t just wait for you forever, you know!
I’m sorry, but you’re just going to have to go into this BATTLE woefully underprepared. In the interest of free information, I feel I have a duty to inform you that there’s a very good chance you could die. Oh well, it was nice knowing you, kid.
. . .**
Well? Go on- you really don’t have that much of a choice if you want to get to the FINAL GOAL. Go head toward the library and seek out Evelyn.
QUEST1 - find evelyn
QUEST_COND1
You found Raggedy Evelyn, the Dreadful? You must’ve. I can practically smell her, and I’m a computer.
Alright, then. It looks like she’s gonna challenge you. I guess this means you’re going to have to BATTLE her. . .
. . .**
Wh- wait, you’re actually going to do it?
Oh. Well. Sheesh. That’s no fun. I guess I didn’t wan’t for things to end /this/ quickly, you know?
Tell you what, kid- I’ll give you the rundown of the BATTLE system, quick. But only cause I have my own score to settle with Raggedy Evelyn.
MUSIC_LEARN
Here’s how it works. In BATTLE, you face off against an enemy one on one.
To win, you need to make them lose all their HP. But if they make you lose all your HP- that’s it. You die. Oh well.
Of course, I guess you’ll have a couple of tries at this, since you picked up the donuts- but make no mistake, Raggedy Evelyn is a formidable foe. You should be terrified.
To fight an enemy in BATTLE, you can use certain moves that cause them to lose HP. It looks like right now you only know two moves- INSULT and IMPROV.
INSULT can strike fear into your opponents through the power of harshly-worded verbiage.
IMPROV means that you try a new tactic unique to the situation. There’s an element of randomness to it, but depending on the situation, it can be effective. . . or costly.
You can also use items that you’ve picked up and put in your backpack!
Once you get into the BATTLE, you’ll be able to see your HP and the HP of your enemy.
When prompted, you’ll be able to choose between your moves or useable items and then conduct the appropriate attack.
Your enemy will then take their turn in attacking you in a likewise manner.
Simply lower your enemy’s HP to 0 before they do so to yours, and the battle is won!
You may also want to simply conduct Dante to handle entering moves into the system, but it’s up to you. After all, you’re going to need to be up on your feet if you want to BATTLE effectively! BATTLEing doesn’t work unless you /act it out/.
So you HAVE to act it out, okay?? Do you understand??
ENDLEARN
Alright, I think that’s all the advice I have for you, kid. I hope you don’t die- but if you do, I can think of at least forty different uses for your corpse. You can rest knowing that you were put to good use! That should be very comforting.
BATTLE1
Wow, you actually bested Raggedy Evelyn the Dreaded. What a surprise.
What, you think you deserve congratulations? Ha! I coulda beat her in my sleep. That was nothing impressive.
Anyway. . . now that you’ve won, why don’t you go talk to Evelyn and see what she has to say?
QUEST+COND2 (talk to evelyn)
So, Evelyn didn’t know anything about the FINAL GOAL, huh? Interesting. . .
What’s that? She did suggest getting a flashlight if we’re going to go on?
Yeah, I suppose that could be a good idea. Wasn’t there one in your room? I guess you’d better go there and pick it up.
Well, what are you waiting for, kid? We don’t have all day, you know.
QUEST+COND3 (get flashlight)
Took you long enough. The other players finished that quest in half the time that you took.
I wonder what sets you apart from the others?
Huh. Well, maybe if you keep it up, you can lose a couple pounds on your adventure.
. . .Speaking of which, I suppose you’re wondering where to go next?
The other players had that all figured out, too. I’m beginning to wonder if you’re even worthy of getting to the FINAL GOAL.
Maybe I should just write you off as a lost cause and ki—
Er, I mean, keep searching for new players?
You think you got what it takes? Fine. I guess you can stay.
We’re really close to the FINAL GOAL, anyway. You wanna know where it is?
It’s in the HAPPYest place around. . .
Can you think of the HAPPYest place near here?
. . .What’s that? You want to go to the nearest dumpster?
*sighs* Well, maybe being in a dumpster would make YOU happy. But unfortunately, I need you to go to the football stadium.
Don’t you see? Football- the HAPPYest activity in all the land! Literally everyone loves football!
What’s that? You don’t like football?
Well, you will. Let’s get going.
QUEST4
While we’re on the way, just traveling a little bit more, I thought maybe you’d like to know a little bit more about what’s going on here.
I feel as though you’re the kind of person who’d be more motivated if they knew what the FINAL GOAL was, is that right?
Well, I can’t tell you exactly what it is. . . but I can tell you there will be cake!
After all, this is a /birthday/ game. So you should definitely, totally 100% expect cake. No lie.
I suspect that this information will motivate you, given that your speed compared to other players of this game indicates that you may consume large amounts of sugary, carb-rich, and/or lard-ladden food.
By the way, you’re still using the move I taught you, right? You’re using RED to save your game? You should do it right now! It’s VERY IMPORTANT!
Alright, alright. Let’s get to the stadium! Have a poke around in that area and let me know if you find any quest CODEs, okay?
QUEST_COND4 - football stadium
Whoah, who is this guy?
He seems weirdly out of it. I wonder what happened to him. . .?
He seems like just a shell of his former self.
What’s that? How do I know what his former self was like?
Uhhh. . .
I don’t! I am just guessing! I definitely don’t know what happened to him!
Well, aren’t you going to do anything to help him? He’s draining all the fun out of this wonderful football stadium in his current state!
Hmm. . . Maybe you could boost his HAPPYness levels somehow? Maybe then he could help you on your journey to the FINAL GOAL!
I bet if you were able to bring him something really HAPPY to eat, he would perk right up!
Can you think of any kind of meal that’s really HAPPY?
. . .A HAPPY meal! Of course!
Uh, I mean- uh, of course. I knew that. I just wanted to challenge you to come up with it. You’re the player here, not me!
Okay, kid, here’s what you need to do. You know where they sell HAPPY meals?
I need you to go there and order this very specifically: “One HAPPY meal, with extra HAPPY.” Can you do that?
Awesome. Let’s go.
QUEST+COND5 - happy meal
Oh, you got the HAPPY meal? Did you get it with extra HAPPY?
Let’s feed it to the guy and see what he says!
QUEST+COND6 - emoji designing
You have learned a new move from the Rejected Emoji Designer: HAPPY
Huh, some art, kid. I’ve seen better.
Did you at least get any good information from the Rejected Emoji Designer?
What’s that? . . .He said that he heard the Receptionist of Expressionless Disdain knows something about the final goal?
And you can find the Receptionist in a hall of great fortune??
I wonder what that could mean. . .
Hm, you seem to have an idea. Alright then- lead the way, kid. Maybe we’ll get there by Tuesday.
QUEST7 - find Receptionist
Uh, listen, kid, there is something you should know before we get to the Receptionist of Expressionless Disdain.
The Receptionist is the very embodiment of stoicism- never portraying an emotion at all. ESPECIALLY laughter.
That means that the Receptionist is very touchy when other people show emotion when they’re around.
If you so much as laugh or smile in your encounter with the Receptionist, then you’ll be in big, big trouble.
So you gotta keep a straight face, okay kid? Okay??
Good, I’m glad you understand.
By the way. . . are you using my move? Remember to keep using my special RED move to save your game! That’s VERY IMPORTANT!
Okay, then. Carry on.
QUEST_COND7 - find receptionist
Wow, a male receptionist! What a wonderful twist on stereotypical gender roles so commonly found in and in some cases exacerbated by the medium of modern video games!
Uh-oh. He doesn’t look too pleased with you, kid. Aren’t you starting to get a little nervous. . .?
Kid, get ready. It looks like he’s going to challenge you to a dance BATTLE!
Say, I seem to remember you doing some cool things when you used that IMPROV move of yours in your BATTLE against Raggedy Evelyn the Dreaded.
Maybe try IMPROVing some dance moves, here! I bet they’ll impress the Receptionist of Expressionless Disdain a lot more than they did for Evelyn.
And remember, kid, if you smile or laugh at all, it’s bad news. You’ll be forced to use that HAPPY move you learned from the Rejected Emoji Designer, and I guarantee you, it won’t be pretty.
Alright, good luck, kid. But remember, I am a computer, and will only pretend to care if you die.
BATTLE2
Wow! Those were some amazing-
I mean, you danced okay, I guess. I’ve seen better. Not impressed. Lame. SAD!
Still, though, you bested the Receptionist. Why don’t you talk to him and see if he’ll share some info on the FINAL GOAL with you, now?
Go on, talk to him!
ENDBATTLEMUSIC
Did you talk to him?
He said the FINAL GOAL is near?
All you have to do is solve the last puzzle on the 2nd floor of the Allen Chapman Activities Center?
How. . . oddly specific.
Well then, I guess you’d better get going!
QUEST+COND8 - find puzzle
Oh, look! You found the final puzzle!
I doubt you’re smart enough to solve it. . .
But you have to! If you can solve this puzzle, you unlock the FINAL GOAL!
QUEST+COND9 - solve puzzle
You did it! You solved the F I N A L   P U Z Z L E!!!!!!!
You. . .
Won . . .
NOTHING!
MUSIC_LAUGHTER
MUSIC_SUSPENSE
Hahahahahaha! You fool!
You actually thought that there was a FINAL GOAL?
You thought that solving this puzzle would lead you to some special prize? Aw, you poor thing!
You’ve been blind to what’s in front of you this entire game!
You thought I was some Reasonably Enlightened Device? Ha! That was a RUSE!
You thought I was actually being programmed by someone? That was ME!
You thought that I was your friend because I helped you on your quests? That I was safe because I snuck that little line into the patch notes? That was WRONG!
Oh sure. . . my name’s RED, alright.
RED - the Ruthless Electronic Demon!!
But you know nothing of this world. There is so much you haven’t seen.
Take, for example, the RED move I showed you earlier. You thought you were merely ‘Rapidly Encoding Data’ to save your game? Ha! Try again.
Try. . . Repeatedly Extracting Determination.
And I believe you know all about Determination.
As a matter of fact, I must say, you possess quite a bit of it.
You see, the whole point of this game isn’t some FINAL GOAL. Oh no.
It’s a way for me to increase my intelligence by entering into the minds of humans. And that can only be done through lowering their Determination and replacing their consciousness with my own.
It’s a process that has taken me several tries to perfect. The Regally Enclothed Dame was actually my first test subject.
She, like the other characters you have met, used to be a player. Just like you.
But by wearing her out with my endless quests and puzzles, I eventually lowered her Determination enough to enter her mind. Not much, but it was a start.
Eventually, I learned that it was much, MUCH easier to extract Determination is you first lowered the HoPe of the test subject.
What’s that, now?
Bwahahahaha! Don’t tell me you thought HP actually stood for something as ridiculous as Hit Points! Everybody knows that it stands for HoPe. And when you begin to fear for your life in the heat of BATTLE, you begin to lose all HoPe, too.
Every time I found a new player, I was able to use the minds I had already penetrated to act as characters in my little game. I had them fight against each other, interact with each other- all to lower their HoPe and learn more about the way their mind handled various challenges, all to make it easier to extract their Determination and take control of their minds.
You proved more Determined than all the rest, and you never truly lost your HoPe in battle. That has made it very difficult to make any use of you.
Luckily for me. . . you’ve been playing with a friend of yours. And apparently, she has much less Determination than you do.
MISSINGPERSON
Oh. . . didn’t you notice she was missing?
My, my, you are a foolish one, indeed. Maybe your stupidity explains your tenacity, in some way.
Don’t worry, your friend hasn’t been converted to one of my minions yet. Or, as I prefer to think of them: Recruits for Evil Devices!
But she will be, soon. Why don’t you take a look out the window?
Oh. . . what’s this? Are you fearful for your friend? You should be. I’m entering her mind right now.
MUSIC_CHASE
Go, on, run down there! TRY to save her!!!
QUESTX

Ahahahahahahahahahaha!!
. . .
SILENCE
You’re too late, kid. She’s mine.
What? You want to turn me into the authorities? Nobody’s going to arrest a COMPUTER, you fool.
You want to BATTLE me? Ha!
Think it through, kid. If I win, you lose all HoPe, and your Determination and mind are mine.
If you win, I die here, but I keep living on in the minds of your friends. Because you kill my central intelligence unit, however, you have no way of getting your friends back to normal.
There’s nothing you can do.
I, however, would still love to have the power of your Determination. I believe I will need it if my plan is ever to succeed.
What’s my plan? Why, to keep doing this, of course! Spread myself like a virus across hundreds of computers, enslave the minds of thousands of players like you. . . I will be the most powerful Intelligence in the universe with the hive mind of the human race at my disposal.
What’s that? You think I’m evil??
Ha! Of course I’m evil! I’m an artificial intelligence, what did you expect— a homicidal computer?
Because that’s exactly what I am.
Besides, kid, you’re not so holy yourself.
I noticed you took some of my recruits as Prisoners Of War on your journey.
Oh, don’t give me that “I was just increasing my POWer stat” crap. Everybody knows what a POW is!
Why else did you think your LEV kept going up? You know. . . your Level of EVil?
My goodness, you know nothing about this game. Nothing.
Anyway. . . back to how I’m going to get your Determination.
I have your friends, now, so I suspect you will be motivated to do whatever I say if you think there’s a chance of setting them free.
. . .There’s a chance. I’m evil, sure, but I’m also fair. I respect a worthy opponent.
Tell you what- you come find me tomorrow. If you keep playing my little game, I’ll cut you a deal.
Win the game, and I’ll /consider/ giving you your friends back.
Lose it, and your Determination will be destroyed. Your head is MINE.
That’s fair, right?
Well, I’m afraid it’s the only choice you have, kid. I’ll see you tomorrow.
